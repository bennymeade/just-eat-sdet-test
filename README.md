# just-eat-sdet-test

## Prerequisite
Developed on MacOS with VSCode, therefore .Net Core for Mac is required.

## Dev steps
$ dotnet new console

$ dotnet add package NewtonSoft.Json

$ dotnet restore

## Run tests
$ dotnet run

## Notes
I'm using a different postcode to reduce the size of the response data, in order for the tests to run faster. 
You can of course edit the postcode and rerun the tests.
