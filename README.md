# just-eat-sdet-test

## Prerequisite
Developed on MacOS with VSCode, therefore .Net Core (v5.0) for Mac is required.

## Build project
$ dotnet restore

(fyi this will add the obj folder)

## Run tests
$ dotnet run

(fyi this will add the bin folder)

## Notes
I'm using a different postcode to reduce the size of the response data, in order for the tests to run faster. 
You can of course edit the postcode and rerun the tests.
