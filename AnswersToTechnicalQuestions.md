Q. How long did you spend on the technical test?
A. - approx 2.5 hours
    - I had to configure my MacOS VSCode for .Net
    - It’s been a few years since I coded in C# so I had to look up syntax on a number of occasions

Q. What would you add to your solution if you had more time?
A. - I would add more validation around the various types within a response.

Q. If you didn't spend much time on the technical test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.
A. - I believe I spent a sufficient amount of time on this test.

Q. What do you think is the most interesting trend in test automation?
A - I think peoples attention spans are continually decreasing with regards to web, so UX design testing should/could somehow be part of the overall QA coverage (while liaising with UX designers). If this is not a trend then it should be.

Q. How would you implement test automation in a legacy application? Have you ever had to do this?
A. - Yes I have had to do this and the process is not different to modern tech. I worked on a 3 year project with the Financial Ombudsman during the PPI (personal protector insurance) major issue. I carried out a POC in automation tools for their in-house WPF application, that was used by all customer support staff. The POC highlighted Ranorex Test Automation Tool as the strongest GUI automation tool available at the time. And over 4 years later I know that framework is still in use there today as I’m still friends with colleagues from that time.

Q. How would you improve the customer experience of the Just Eat website?
A. - The priority focus here is not what I would improve but let’s analyse the https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.justeat.co.uk reviews. In fairness every website has a low rating on Trust Pilot, but I’d be keen to understand what metrics and customer feedback tools are in place to allow customers to report issues directly into Just Eat Tech rather than their first though to use Trust Pilot.
